# Threads

This repository contains code examples related to multithreading and concurrency in Java.

[Conflicts](https://github.com/netodotcom/threads/tree/main/Conflicts/Conflicts)
In the Conflicts folder, there is an example simulation of conflicts that can arise in multithreaded applications.

[Synchronization](https://github.com/netodotcom/threads/tree/main/Conflicts/Synchronization)
In the Synchronization folder, the conflict is resolved using the synchronized keyword in Java.

[Lock](https://github.com/netodotcom/threads/tree/main/Conflicts/Lock)
In the Lock folder, the conflict is resolved using the Lock library in Java.

[Semaphore](https://github.com/netodotcom/threads/tree/main/Conflicts/Semaphore)
In the Semaphore folder, the conflict is resolved using the Semaphore library in Java.

Each folder contains a separate example and instructions on how to run the code. These examples can be useful for understanding how to deal with common issues that arise in multithreaded applications, such as race conditions, deadlocks, and starvation.
